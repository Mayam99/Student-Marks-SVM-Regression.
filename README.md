# Student Marks Prediction Using SVM Regression with Hyper-Parameter Tuning

This repository showcases a step-by-step implementation of Support Vector Machine (SVM) Regression for predicting student marks. Using a dataset from Kaggle, the project demonstrates a comprehensive approach to data preprocessing, model development, and hyper-parameter tuning, ultimately aimed at optimizing prediction accuracy. The project highlights the practical applications of SVM in regression tasks, especially in educational data analysis.

##Project Overview

* Dataset: Student Marks Dataset from Kaggle
* Goal: To predict student marks based on key influencing factors.
* Techniques Used:
1. Support Vector Machine (SVM) for regression
2. Grid Search for hyper-parameter tuning
3. Cross-validation for model evaluation

#Key Steps

1. Data Preprocessing: Initial data inspection, handling missing values, and encoding categorical features.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis: Understanding feature relationships through statistical analysis and visualizations.
3. SVM Model Development: Building a baseline SVM regression model.
4. Hyper-Parameter Tuning: Utilizing GridSearchCV for optimizing the model’s kernel, regularization (C), and epsilon (ε) parameters.
5. Evaluation and Visualization: Assessing model performance with R-squared and Mean Squared Error metrics, and visualizing predictions.

# Results

The model’s performance was enhanced through hyper-parameter tuning, leading to a notable increase in accuracy. Visualizations provide insights into how well the predicted marks align with actual marks.
